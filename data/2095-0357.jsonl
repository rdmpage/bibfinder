Such information is needed to make informed decisions concerning the conservation and management of this species. Four A. davidianus raised in a pool were released into their native habitat on 04 May 2005 and were subsequently radio-tracked for approximately 155?168 days. Following their release, the giant salamanders tra?veled upstream in search of suitable micro-habitats, and settled after 10 days. Later, a devastating summer flash flood destroyed the salamanders’ dens, triggering another bout of habitat searching by the animals. Eventually, the salamanders settled in different sections of the stream where they remained until the end of the study. On average, each habitat searching endeavor took 7.5 days, during which a giant salamander explored a 310 m stretch of stream with a surface area of about 1157 m2 and occupied 3.5 temporary dwellings. Each giant salamander spent an average of 144.5 days in semi-permanent micro-habitats, and occupied territories that had a mean size of 34.75 m2. Our results indicate that the Chinese giant salamander responds to habitat disturbance by seeking new habitats upstream, both water temperature and water level affect the salamander’s habitat searching activity, and the size of the salamander’s semi-permanent territory is influenced by the size of the pool containing the animal’s den.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Zheng","family":"Hexun"},{"given":"Wang","family":"Xiaoming"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"1","issue":"1","page":"31-35","page-first":"31","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2010.00031","SICI:2095-0357(2010)1<31:TDREAB>2.0.CO;2-X"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2010.00031","SICI":"2095-0357(2010)1<31:TDREAB>2.0.CO;2-X","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2010.00031"}

Our data show that the injection of only HCG could not, while that of only LHRH-A could, facilitate sexual behavior along with testicular recrudescence and spermatogenesis in S. quadriocellata. The injection of both LHRH-A and HCG would induce more drastic sexual behavior of the animals than that of LHRH-A alone, indicating HCG enhances the effects of LHRH-A induced sexual behavior. However, different pharmacological dosages of LHRH-A (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg per 100 g bodyweight) did not correspond to different activity levels.

Overall, we found the population to be susceptible to the factors of catastrophic events, mortality and environment capacity. The population is recovering slowly at present on account of improvement of habitat and greater food availability. Under the current conditions, the probability of extinction in 100 years is approximately zero. These data coincide with the evidence that the wild population may be arriving at K.

A major challenge is the efficient rearing of tadpoles, many of which require complex habitats and specialised diets. Aquatic tadpoles of the West Australian frog Litoria moorei were kept at low density (1 tadpole per 1.95 litres water) in aquaria at 25°C. Fed on a staple diet of boiled lettuce and leaf litter, group of diets were supplemented with either control, Wardley? Premium Spirulina Discs, Sera? GVG-mix tropical fish food, or a combination of Wardley? Premium Spirulina discs and Sera? GVG-mix fish food. There was a relatively high loss (i.e., found dead, euthanized due to scoliosis, or not found) of tadpoles fed with the lettuce/leaf litter alone, but this was increased significantly when supplemented with Wardley? Premium Spirulina discs, either alone or with Sera? GVG-mix fish food , and Sera? GVG fish food alone. However, the survived tadpoles fed on the three supplements were all heavier after three weeks and at metamorphosis than those fed with lettuce/leaf litter alone, and reached metamorphosis quicker. It is concluded that any benefit of the food supplements in terms of increasing the rate of growth and development of the tadpoles is outweighed by greater mortality. There is now a need for the efficient rearing of tadpoles, many from novel species that need complex habitats. Further studies of diet are required due to the current conservation crisis of amphibians.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Phillip","family":"Matson"},{"given":"Glen","family":"Gaikhorst"},{"given":"Wendy","family":"Kappelle"},{"given":"Sandy","family":"Webb"},{"given":"Suzanne","family":"Brown"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"1","issue":"2","page":"103-110","page-first":"103","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2010.00103","SICI:2095-0357(2010)1<103:EDATGD>2.0.CO;2-E"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2010.00103","SICI":"2095-0357(2010)1<103:EDATGD>2.0.CO;2-E","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2010.00103"}

From 2004 to 2007, two successful techniques were applied to initiate reproductive behavior: 1) injecting exogenous reproductive hormones; and 2) reducing the stress of living in captivity. As a result of the hormone treatments, courtship behavior and copulation were observed during September and October, 2005. However, no courtship displays were seen from the CK males, which were not treated with hormones. Ovulation occurred between December and March, and the correlation was not significant between behavior of ovulation and food intake. Females laid only one clutch of eggs each year, with 2.47 eggs (n=34, range=1?4) at average, and 84 eggs were totally obtained, of which 13 were damaged, 52 were infertile and 19 fertile.

In this study, molecular and morphological data were combined to evaluate the validity of P. parviformis.

The results of ML, MP and Bayesian analyses suggest that P. parviformis might be paraphyletic to P. sinensis, whereas the partitioned Bayesian analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of P. parviformis and P. sinensis. Considering the advantages of heterogenous characteristics of sequence evolution, we choose the result of partitioned Bayesian analyses. Furthermore, the morphological data lend support the distinct species status of P. parviformis and P. sinensis, such as tubercles on carapace skin, color of plastron skin, dark spots on plastron, basisphenoid characteristics (ratio of the smallest width to the largest width; the smallest width of basisphenoid is restrained by two holes on each side) and the shape of entoplastron.

For each frog, total weight and ovarian/testicular weight were measured to obtain the female and male gonadosomatic index. The number of female individuals with mature eggs (postvitellogenic eggs) was also counted. The results showed that female frogs had two main surges of increased GSI in March and September of 2008. Alternatively, male frogs showed a more gradual increase and decrease in gonadosomatic index, thus the index remaining high throughout the year.

In total, twenty-nine species are known to inhabit the area. Of these eight are endemic to the area: Boiga hoeseli, Coelognathus subradiatus, Dendrelaphis inornatus, Stegonotus florensis, Cylindrophis opisthorhodus, Broghammerus timoriensis, Liasis mackloti and Typhlops schmutzi. Insular endemism is only found at the subspecific level, including Liasis mackloti dunni (Wetar), Liasis mackloti savuensis (Sawu), Ramphotyphlops polygrammicus brongersmai (Sumba), Ramphotyphlops polygrammicus elberti (Lombok) and Ramphotyphlops polygrammicus florensis (Flores). Such endemism may be due to the relatively young geological age of the Lesser Sunda Islands and that the snake fauna is still underestimated. Taxonomy of the genus Cylindrophis, the species Coelognathus subradiatus, Dendrelaphis inornatus, Cryptelytrops insularis, and the five subspecies of Ramphotyphlops polygrammicus need to be reviewed. Ecological studies are urgently required to establish if the species Broghammerus timoriensis and Liasis mackloti savuensis are endangered and which conservation measures should be taken.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,16]]},"author":[{"given":"Ruud","family":"De Lang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"2","issue":"1","page":"46-54","page-first":"46","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00046","SICI:2095-0357(2011)2<46:TSOTLS>2.0.CO;2-I"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00046","SICI":"2095-0357(2011)2<46:TSOTLS>2.0.CO;2-I","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2011.00046"}

A principal components analysis of morphometric data, molecular analyses, and the exclusive breeding season suggested the occurrence of two species. The population that breeds during the winter was found to be an undescribed species and was subsequently described as Rana jiemuxiensis sp. nov. The new cryptic species can be identified from its congeners at the same locality by having a different breeding season and a divergent DNA barcode. Six major lineages of brown frogs were resolved with high nodal support. Rana japonica, R. chaochiaoensis, R. omeimontis, and R. jiemuxiensis have independent maternal lineages. Rana hanlunica and R. maoershanensis have essentially identical maternal lineages and they appear to represent the same species. The validity of the species R. longicrus, R. zhenhaiensis, and R. culaiensis and their genealogical relationships are not resolved and deserve further study. The genealogy indicates that sympatric cryptic lineages probably widely exist in the R. longicrus group.

We argue that both delayed attainment of sexual maturity and low fecundity make this species more vulnerable to extinction.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6,15]]},"author":[{"given":"Weizhao","family":"Yang"},{"given":"Chang","family":"Liu"},{"given":"Jianping","family":"Jiang"},{"given":"Cheng","family":"Li"},{"given":"Feng","family":"Xie"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"2","issue":"2","page":"91-96","page-first":"91","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00091","SICI:2095-0357(2011)2<91:ASOFIA>2.0.CO;2-F"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00091","SICI":"2095-0357(2011)2<91:ASOFIA>2.0.CO;2-F","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2011.00091"}

Female SVL, clutch size, egg volume and clutch volume varied significantly among populations. With increase in latitude, clutch size increased, while egg size decreased. Relatively fewer but larger eggs were produced with increasing of population density. Food availability had positive effects on clutch size, but no effect on egg size.

Between February and March of 2011, 19 female and 43 male L. boringii from Mount Emei UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sichuan, China were observed throughout the breeding season. This species exhibits male-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) with limited evidence of paternal care (nest guarding by males). Prior to the breeding season males grow 10 ? 16 keratinized spines on their upper lip, which fall off once the season has ended. Throughout the breeding season males construct and defend aquatic nests where they produce advertisement calls to attract females. During this time we documented 14 cases involving a total of 22 males where males used their moustaches for aggressive interaction. Combat typically occurred at the beginning of the season when males would compete for a limited number of available nest sites. Neither male body size, nor body condition significantly affects the outcome of an aggressive interaction, suggesting that size may not be the only factor influencing an individual’s chance of victory. Our evidence for male competition and aggression, along with observed paternal care are potential mechanisms to explain the evolution of male-biased SSD observed in this species.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,15]]},"author":[{"given":"Cameron M","family":"Hudson"},{"given":"Xianjin","family":"He"},{"given":"Jinzhong","family":"Fu"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"2","issue":"3","page":"142-148","page-first":"142","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00142","SICI:2095-0357(2011)2<142:KNSAUF>2.0.CO;2-B"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00142","SICI":"2095-0357(2011)2<142:KNSAUF>2.0.CO;2-B","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2011.00142"}

Typically, males vocalize in choruses during one or more periods in a twenty-four-hour cycle, which varies, however, among species. Nevertheless, the causal factors influencing circadian variations of calling patterns in anuran species are not clear. In this study, male chorus vocalizations were monitored in the Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) for 17 consecutive days during the breeding season, while its habitat air temperature and relative humidity in the course of experiments were measured as well. The results revealed that the circadian calling patterns were characterized by two periods of peak vocalization, which were observed from 0500 h to 0700 h and from 1300 h to 2000 h, while the lowest activity period was found from 2100 h to 2200 h. Both calls/h and notes/h were positively correlated with air temperature and negatively with relative humidity. Overall, our data indicate that the Emei music frogs (B. daunchina) could regulate their vocal activities based on the changes of physical micro-environment (e. g., temperature or humidity) to maximize reproductive success.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,15]]},"author":[{"given":"Jianguo","family":"Cui#"},{"given":"Xiaoyan","family":"Song#"},{"given":"Guangzhan","family":"Fang"},{"given":"Fei","family":"Xu"},{"given":"Steven E","family":"Brauth"},{"given":"Yezhong","family":"Tang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"2","issue":"3","page":"149-154","page-first":"149","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00149","SICI:2095-0357(2011)2<149:CROCBI>2.0.CO;2-#"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00149","SICI":"2095-0357(2011)2<149:CROCBI>2.0.CO;2-#","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2011.00149"}

Specimens were collected from a small island in the Southeast Aegean Sea. The dominant prey group of juveniles consisted of Collembola, while Coleoptera dominated the diet of males and females. The number and size of prey items consumed by males and females of L. luschani basoglui were quite similar, while juveniles ate fewer items of much smaller size. The numerical abundance along with the four measures of the size of prey permitted discrimination among males, females and juveniles. Although discrimination between adults and juveniles is expected due to dissimilarity in body size, discrimination between males and females remains inexplicable despite their similarity in body size. Future studies should be focused on understanding how and why prey choice differs between sexes in L. luschani basoglui.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9,15]]},"author":[{"given":"Rosa-Maria","family":"Polymeni"},{"given":"Canella","family":"Radea"},{"given":"Costis","family":"Papanayotou"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"2","issue":"3","page":"155-160","page-first":"155","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00155","SICI:2095-0357(2011)2<155:DCOTSL>2.0.CO;2-Q"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2011.00155","SICI":"2095-0357(2011)2<155:DCOTSL>2.0.CO;2-Q","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2011.00155"}

By using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likehood (ML) approaches, Thermophis was demonstrated as the sister group to the North American relicts of Dipsadinae, and rooted in Central and South American members of this subfamily. The results suggest that the closest relatives of Thermophis are the North American relicts, and thus support the hypothesis for an Asian-North American origin of xenodontine snakes as suggested by Vidal et al.

One of the three original specimens is crushed and the other two are neonates, which precludes a morphological analysis. Three adult snakes (2 females, 1 male) collected from Jiangzha Hot Spring in Zoige County, Sichuan, China on 26 July 2010 now facilitate the species’ description. Mitochondrial DNA nucleotide sequences of cytochrome b (cyt b), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA), and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) from the adults are identical to sequences from the crashed specimen. Interspecific uncorrected p-distances of partial CO1 gene of 26 sequences from all 11 species of Elaphe, including this new species, are large (8.5?15.2%). This new species is morphologically distinguished from all other species of Elaphe by several characters: “M”-shaped marking on the supraoculars and adjacent frontal; four parallel series of red-brown spots on the dorsum extending from the neck to the vent; four longitudinal stripes associated with the spots; each spot is usually composed of a whole (or incomplete) red-brown scale with puce borders; spots of each stripe are similar in shape, they occur at relatively regular intervals of one or two scales, and they are slightly red-brown in color; and it has three preoculars, whereas all other species have one or two. Now Elaphe contains 11 species and this discovery highlights the need for continued exploration of temperate regions.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Song","family":"Huang"},{"given":"Li","family":"Ding"},{"given":"Frank T","family":"Burbrink"},{"given":"Jun","family":"Yang"},{"given":"Jietang","family":"Huang"},{"given":"Chen","family":"Ling"},{"given":"Xin","family":"Chen"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"1","page":"38-45","page-first":"38","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00038","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<38:ANSOTG>2.0.CO;2-C"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00038","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<38:ANSOTG>2.0.CO;2-C","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00038"}

For studying the spatial distribution pattern of the steppe toad-headed lizard (Phrynocephalus frontalis) and its influencing factors, we conducted experiments in Hunshandake Sandy Land in Inner Mongolia, China in July 2009. By calculating the clustered indices, we found that the lizard was aggregately distributed when the sampling quadrat was smaller than 10 m × 10 m, and uniformly distributed when it was greater than 10 m × 10 m. The Nearest Neighbor Rule showed a clustering distribution pattern for P. frontalis and the distribution pattern was quadrat-sampling dependent. Furthermore, the cluster was determined by environmental factors when the sampling quadrat was smaller than 20 m × 20 m, but it was determined by both environmental factors and characteristics of the lizard when it was larger than 20 m × 20 m. Our results suggested that the steppe toad-headed lizards tended to aggregate into suitable habitat patches in desert areas. Additionally, we discussed that the lizard aggregation could be potentially used as an indictor of movement of sand dunes.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Xue","family":"Lian"},{"given":"Zhigang","family":"Jiang"},{"given":"Xiaoge","family":"Ping"},{"given":"Songhua","family":"Tang"},{"given":"Junhuai","family":"Bi"},{"given":"Chunwang","family":"Li"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"1","page":"46-51","page-first":"46","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00046","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<46:SDPOTS>2.0.CO;2-R"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00046","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<46:SDPOTS>2.0.CO;2-R","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00046"}

A fragment of mtDNA ND4-tRNALEU from 189 samples in 26 populations was used to infer the phylogeographic history of this species complex in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. vlangalii and another proposed species (P. putjatia) do not form a monophyletic mtDNA clade, which in contrast with a previous study, includes P. theobaldi and P. forsythii. Lineage diversification occurred in the Middle Pleistocene for P. vlangali (ca. 0.95 Ma) and in the Early Pleistocene for P. putjatia (ca. 1.78 Ma). The uplift of the A’nyemaqen Mountains and glaciations since the mid-late Pleistocene, especially during the Kunlun Glaciation, are considered to have promoted the allopartric divergence of P. vlangalii. The diversification of P. putjatia may be triggered by the tectonic movement in the Huangshui River valley during the C phase of Qingzang Movement. Subsequently, the glacial climate throughout the Pleistocene may have continued to impede the gene flow of P. putjatia, eventually resulting in the genetic divergence of P. putjatia in the allopatric regions. Demographic estimates revealed weak population expansion in one lineage of P. vlangalii (A2, the Qaidam Basin lineage) and one lineage of P. putjatia (B2, the north Qinghai Lake lineage) after approximately 42 000 years before present. However, constant population size through time was inferred for two lineages (A1 and B1), the source of Yellow River lineage of P. vlangalii and the southeast of Qinghai Lake lineage of P. putjatia, possibly due to stable populations persisting in areas unaffected by glacial advances. Our results also suggest: 1) at least four differentiated lineages of P. vlangalii complex may have evolved allopatrically in different regions during the Pleistocene glaciation events; 2) in support of several recent studies, P. putjatia is a valid species, having a more wide distribution than previously considered; and 3) a hypothesis referring to P. v. hongyuanensis, inhabiting in the source region of the Yellow River, being synonymous with P. v. pylozwi is supported.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Xianguang","family":"Guo"},{"given":"Li","family":"Liu"},{"given":"Yuezhao","family":"Wang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"1","page":"52-68","page-first":"52","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00052","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<52:POTPVS>2.0.CO;2-Q"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00052","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<52:POTPVS>2.0.CO;2-Q","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00052"}

Since amphibians are highly sensitive to moisture changes, amphibian assemblages were used as a monitoring parameter to evaluate the effects of check dams on biotic components in this study. Comparison of amphibian assemblages between check dam and non-check dam areas was conducted along ephemeral streams in a tropical deciduous forest of the Chulalongkorn University Forest and Research Station in Nan Province, Thailand from April 2009 to March 2010. Five transects, including the stream transect, and 5, 10, 25, and 50 m terrestrial transects, were used for amphibian surveys between the two areas. Physical factors related to moisture were also compared between these areas. It was found that hydroperiod in the check dam stream was significantly higher than that in the non-check dam stream. Soil moisture content at most terrestrial transects in the check dam area was significantly higher than that in the non-check dam area, while similarity in leaf litter moisture content was found in most transects. Simpson’s index of diversity indicated that amphibian diversities in all transects were equally diverse between the two areas in both wet and dry seasons. Cluster analysis of similarity in species composition indicated that amphibian composition in the check dam stream was distinct from that in the non-check dam stream in the wet season or the functional period of the check dam. However, the amphibian compositions in both check dam and non-check dam streams were similar to each other in the dry season. No significant check dam effect was found on species composition in the terrestrial habitats in both seasons. Overall, using a highly moisture-sensitive vertebrate as a bio-indicator, the results showed that the check dams and the changes in moisture-related physical factors appear to have little short-term effect on amphibian assemblages.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Ratchata","family":"Phochayavanich"},{"given":"Wichase","family":"Khonsue"},{"given":"Noppadon","family":"Kitana"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"3","page":"175-183","page-first":"175","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00175","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<175:EOCDOA>2.0.CO;2-4"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00175","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<175:EOCDOA>2.0.CO;2-4","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00175"}

Embryogenesis of the two species was not sensitive to changes in the hydric environment except P. przewalskii incubated in 30°C group. Temperature significantly altered the duration of embryogenesis, with cooler temperatures leading to a longer incubation period. Hatching success was greater at 26 and 30°C than at 34°C. The hatchlings incubated at 26 and 30°C had longer snout-vent length, larger body mass, and better locomotor performance than those incubated at 34°C. Compared to P. przewalskii, P. versicolor had a shorter incubation period and yielded smaller hatchlings, which then had a higher survival rate in cooler and drier habitats. We conclude that an incubation temperature of 30°C would produce the best balance among developmental rate, hatching success, and post-hatching performance.

The hatchlings of P. grumgrzimailoi need at least two years to reach sexual maturity, with the smallest mature male and female measured 48.02 mm and 47.01 mm snout-vent length (SVL), respectively. Adult females produce a single clutch per breeding season, with the clutch size ranging from 1 to 5. The clutch size and mass are significantly correlated with female SVL. There is no correlation of mean egg size with clutch size and relative fecundity in P. grumgrzimailoi, suggesting that the trade-off is absent between mean egg size and number. Females increase reproductive output mainly through increasing egg numbers. The copulation period lasts from April to June. Females begin vitellogenesis in April and lay eggs from May to July. Our results suggest that toad-headed lizards tend to select different reproductive strategies to adapt themselves to their arid or semi-arid habitats.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Yang","family":"Liu"},{"given":"Yucheng","family":"Song"},{"given":"Wenrong","family":"Li"},{"given":"Lei","family":"Shi"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"3","page":"198-204","page-first":"198","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00198","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<198:RSACOT>2.0.CO;2-C"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00198","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<198:RSACOT>2.0.CO;2-C","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00198"}

In some species, males evaluate an opponent’s fighting ability and females evaluate male quality on the basis of male communication signals, which are thought to reflect information concerning male body size. Nevertheless, previous studies reveal that male call structure is not always correlated with body size. In the present study we investigated the relationships between body size and call structure in the large treefrog, Rhacophorus dennysi, as well as the relationship of its calling behavior with air temperature and humidity. The results show that both the dominant and fundamental frequencies are negatively correlated with body size, while inter-note intervals are positively correlated with body size, indicating that call characters could reflect body size in this species. Additionally, calling in this tropical species exhibits a circadian rhythm insofar as relatively high temperature and low humidity during the day is associated with less vocal behavior. Thus, individual variations in call structure are mainly dependent on body size while the temporal rhythm of calling activity is affected by environmental conditions in large treefrogs.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Jichao","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Jianguo","family":"Cui"},{"given":"Haitao","family":"Shi"},{"given":"Steven E","family":"Brauth"},{"given":"Yezhong","family":"Tang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"3","page":"205-212","page-first":"205","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00205","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<205:EOBSAE>2.0.CO;2-Y"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00205","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<205:EOBSAE>2.0.CO;2-Y","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00205"}

The degree of geographic intraspecific variation in body dimensions, corporeal ratios and scalation pattern among male and female Palestine vipers (Vipera palaestinae) in Israel were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses using 20 variable features relating to metric and meristic characters were applied in order to determine the existence of geographic variability in this species. Univariate analysis revealed that the majority of morphological characters possess relatively minor interregional distinctions, with only a few traits demonstrating significant differences. Discriminant analysis of mixed-gender samples using a combination of variables did not distinguish between geographic groups within each sex. The multifactor approach slightly differentiated between samples when sexes were compared separately, but with much overlap. The continuous sampling method revealed no statistically significant relationship between geographic and metric variables across the distribution range. A weak latitudinal cline was observed in snout-vent length, with both sexes being larger in the south. Noticeable temperature-correlated intraspecific variability was found in both body and tail scale counts but not in head scalation features. Generally, both males and females demonstrate the same phenotype-environment correlation. The spatial variations in external morphology suggest that temperature conditions during early ontogenesis may induce quantitative changes in the scalation pattern of V. palaestinae.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Stanislav","family":"Volynchik"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"3","page":"227-239","page-first":"227","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00227","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<227:MVIVPA>2.0.CO;2-4"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00227","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<227:MVIVPA>2.0.CO;2-4","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00227"}

Our results reveal that O. tormota possesses specialized phonatory organ structures, with thinner vocal cords modulated by a moderately stronger muscular mastoideus between the medial vocal cords and the lateral cricoid cartilages, and more elastic mouth floor to likely supply faster air stream which could make the vocal cords vibrate at higher frequencies, larger relative distance between the two muscles m. intermandibulares (RDMI), and higher nucleus density of m. intermandibularis (NDMI) and m. geniohyoideus (NDMG). The results of Pearson’s correlation tests between the mean values of the above measurements and the fundamental frequencies from the five species imply that all the specialized phonatory organ structures mentioned above might be favored by higher frequency of phonation of O. tormota.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Rongchuan","family":"Xiong"},{"given":"Bin","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Yuhan","family":"Wu"},{"given":"Jianping","family":"Jiang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"3","issue":"3","page":"240-251","page-first":"240","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00240","SICI:2095-0357(2012)3<240:MCOTPO>2.0.CO;2-C"],"DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1245.2012.00240","SICI":"2095-0357(2012)3<240:MCOTPO>2.0.CO;2-C","guid":"10.3724/sp.j.1245.2012.00240"}

Given that vertebrate immunity against these extracellular pathogens is primarily functioned by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, the characterization and the evolution of amphibian MHC class II genes have attracted increasing attention. The polymorphism of MHC class II genes was found to be correlated with susceptibility to fungal pathogens in many amphibian species, suggesting the importance of studies on MHC class II genes for amphibians. However, such studies on MHC class II gene evolution have rarely been conducted on amphibians in China. In this study, we chose Omei treefrog (Rhacophorus omeimontis), which lived moist environments easy for breeding bacteria, to study the polymorphism of its MHC class II genes and the underlying evolutionary mechanisms. We amplified the entire MHC class IIB exon 2 sequence in the R. omeimontis using newly designed primers. We detected 102 putative alleles in 146 individuals. The number of alleles per individual ranged from one to seven, indicating that there are at least four loci containing MHC class IIB genes in R. omeimontis. The allelic polymorphism estimated from the 102 alleles in R. omeimontis was not high compared to that estimated in other anuran species. No significant gene recombination was detected in the 102 MHC class IIB exon 2 sequences. In contrast, both gene duplication and balancing selection greatly contributed to the variability in MHC class IIB exon 2 sequences of R. omeimontis. This study lays the groundwork for the future researches to comprehensively analyze the evolution of amphibian MHC genes and to assess the role of MHC gene polymorphisms in resistance against extracellular pathogens for amphibians in China.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Li","family":"Huang#"},{"given":"Mian","family":"Zhao#"},{"given":"Zhenhua","family":"Luo"},{"given":"Hua","family":"Wu"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"7","issue":"1","page":"1-11","page-first":"1","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150053","SICI:2095-0357(2016)7<1:APGDAB>2.0.CO;2-5"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150053","SICI":"2095-0357(2016)7<1:APGDAB>2.0.CO;2-5","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150053"}

In this study, we compared the expression of HIF-1A, VEGF, EPAS1 and EPO mRNA between two populations of N. parkeri: one population inhabiting the native high altitudes, and the second living in, and being acclimated to, the lower plains (70 m asl). The expression of HIF-1A, VEGF and EPAS1 mRNA in the high altitude population were significantly higher than in the acclimated population, whereas there was no significant difference for EPO between two groups. Our results indicated that gene expression plasticity may make significant contributions to local adaptation of species that have broad altitudinal distributions. In addition, we deepen our understanding of the adaptive potential of this species by evaluating the experiments in the scope of its evolutionary history.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Qiong","family":"Zhang"},{"given":"Xingzhi","family":"Han"},{"given":"Robert H S","family":"Kraus"},{"given":"Le","family":"Yang"},{"given":"Liqing","family":"Fan"},{"given":"Yinzi","family":"Ye"},{"given":"Yi","family":"Tao"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"7","issue":"1","page":"21-27","page-first":"21","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150056","SICI:2095-0357(2016)7<21:TEPOHR>2.0.CO;2-P"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150056","SICI":"2095-0357(2016)7<21:TEPOHR>2.0.CO;2-P","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150056"}

The site with moderate sound contamination exhibited a disturbed pattern of circadian sound variation, while the site with heavy traffic noise displayed an apparently random temporal soundscape. At different amphibian breeding sites during mating season, our short-term recordings were dominated by anuran calls, bird songs and wind noises, while insect calls and rain were present to a lesser degree.

In this study, we examined the predation of invasive Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis on the eggs, embryos, and tadpoles of Duttaphrynus melanostictus and Pelophylax nigromaculatus in south China. Our results suggested that the survival of eggs and embryos remaining in the egg capsules of P. nigromaculatus and D. melanostictus was significantly higher than those removed from the egg capsule at 12-h intervals within 72 h in the presence of G. affinis. The survival of P. nigromaculatus eggs and embryos without egg capsules was significantly lower than those of D. melanostictus without egg capsules. The survival of P. nigromaculatus eggs and embryos with egg capsules was significantly higher than those of D. melanostictus with egg capsules from 24 h to 72 h except for 12 h. The survival of D. melanostictus tadpoles was significantly higher than that of P. nigromaculatus tadpoles in the presence of G. affinis. The survival of Gosner stage 26 tadpoles of P. nigromaculatus was significantly higher than that of Gosner stage 30 tadpoles from 12 h to 60 h, but there were no significant differences at 72 h. In contrast, the survival of Gosner stage 26 tadpoles of D. melanostictus was significantly lower than that of Gosner stage 30 tadpoles within 72 h, recording every 12h. The increasing temperature caused a significant increase in predation by G. affinis on P. nigromaculatus eggs and embryos. The outer jelly capsule surrounding anurans eggs might serve as a mechanical defense against predation by G. affinis due to its large diameter, relatively stationary state and unpalatability. The differences in the vulnerability of P. nigromaculatus and D. melanostictus embryos and tadpoles to G. affinis probably due to differences in the unpalatability, black skin and activity. Based on the magnitude of predation by G. affinis on the eggs, embryos and tadpoles of these two species and the combined impact of temperature, we might speculate that invasive G.?affinis and global warming would have more detrimental impacts on population viability of P. nigromaculatus than D. melanostictus in China.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Xiaoli","family":"Fan"},{"given":"Zhihua","family":"Lin"},{"given":"Xiang","family":"Li"},{"given":"Li","family":"Wei"},{"given":"Guohua","family":"Ding"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"7","issue":"1","page":"46-52","page-first":"46","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150045","SICI:2095-0357(2016)7<46:EOPBIW>2.0.CO;2-M"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150045","SICI":"2095-0357(2016)7<46:EOPBIW>2.0.CO;2-M","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150045"}

It currently has three known populations: one in Longwangshan, Zhejiang Province (type locality), and two in Qingliangfeng between Anhui and Zhejiang Provinces. We examined the relatively unstudied breeding ecology of this species in the field and at laboratory from March 2007 to May 2014. Adult males and females were year-round terrestrial, except for the February?April breeding season. During this period, we captured only a total of 16 breeding adults (11 males and 5 females). As few as 100 breeding females were estimated based on the number of egg sacs observed since 2007. This number was significantly reduced from the estimated number between 1992 and 1998. Males (mean total length = 16.21 cm, mean body mass = 18.8 g) were slightly smaller than females (16.51 cm, 19.2 g). Size of breeding pools ranged from 0.2 m2 to 1.2 m2 (0.1?1.2 m depths). Each female deposits a pair of egg sacs by attaching the adhesive tips of the sacs to aquatic plants or dead twigs. Fifteen pairs of egg sacs had an average length of 28.6 cm and a diameter of 3.3 cm. On average, each egg sac contained 75 eggs with a diameter of 0.3 cm. Our field survey revealed that H. amjiensis used oviposition sites in small, cool, and weakly acidic pools at high elevations (1 300?1 600 m) where peat moss was abundant. Reduction in wetland size and disappearance of suitable breeding pools suggest that this salamander species is under threat of extinction, particularly at Longwangshan, where 5 of the 9 breeding pools have either dried up or disappeared. Combined size of the remaining 4 pools is less than 2 m2. We urge immediate implementation of more effective conservation measures and suggest that preservation priority should be given to habitat that contains suitable breeding pools.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Cangsong","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Jia","family":"Yang"},{"given":"Yunke","family":"Wu"},{"given":"Zhongyong","family":"Fan"},{"given":"Weiwei","family":"Lu"},{"given":"Shuihua","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Lipeng","family":"Yu"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"7","issue":"1","page":"53-58","page-first":"53","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150050","SICI:2095-0357(2016)7<53:TBEOAC>2.0.CO;2-C"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150050","SICI":"2095-0357(2016)7<53:TBEOAC>2.0.CO;2-C","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150050"}

The results support the hypothesis that male and female signal receiver preferences have coevolved in this species. Specifically, both male and female B. daunchina respond strongly to the heterospecific calls of B. hainanensis, suggesting that preexisting biases exist in both females and males. Both male and female individuals showed a slight response to the calls of B. adenopleura while no response was evoked by the calls of B. lini.

The results indicated that hypoxia exposure decreased Tb, SMR and heart rate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of 8% O2 group became significant elevated in liver and skeletal muscle compared with control group at 20°C, but descended significantly in heart. Using electrophoresis we found that LDH contains five isozymes (LDH1, LDH2, LDH3, LDH4 and LDH5) and are expressed specifically in liver, skeletal muscle and heart. Citrate synthase (CS) activity in the liver also decreased at 20°C and 30°C. No significant difference of CS activity was found between the two groups in skeletal muscle and heart.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Weixin","family":"Li"},{"given":"Shiwei","family":"Liang"},{"given":"Huihui","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Ying","family":"Xin"},{"given":"Songsong","family":"Lu"},{"given":"Xiaolong","family":"Tang"},{"given":"Qiang","family":"Chen"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"7","issue":"2","page":"103-111","page-first":"103","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150010","SICI:2095-0357(2016)7<103:TEOCHO>2.0.CO;2-4"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150010","SICI":"2095-0357(2016)7<103:TEOCHO>2.0.CO;2-4","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.150010"}

The studied lizards predominantly used quadrupedal locomotion at relatively low speeds, but ran bipedally with a digitigrade posture at high speeds. Speed was positively correlated with both stride length and stride frequency, and was negatively correlated with duty factor. Lizards modulated speed probably by a combination of changing frequency and amplitude of limb movements. Within the range of standardized speeds from 50 to 150 cm/s, speed effects on 28 out of a total of 56 kinematic variables were significant. The hip height at footfall increased as speed increased, whereas the amplitude of vertical oscillations of the hip did not vary with speed. The total longitudinal and dorsoventral movements relative to the hip varied with speed for all parts of the limb that were distal to the knee, whereas the lateral movements did not. The knee and ankle angle at footfall varied with speed, but did not at the end of stance. The degree of pelvis rotation during the entire stride cycle did not vary with speed.

In addition, we conducted histological observations on spermatogenesis of the hybrids. The reciprocal hybrids between H. litoralis and H. tigerinus developed normally with somewhat lower viability at the metamorphosis stage compared with the controls. Most of the metamorphosed frogs became mature. On the other hand, almost all hybrids between female H. rugulosus and male H. litoralis or H. tigerinus died of underdevelopment at the tadpole stage, and only a few hybrids metamorphosed normally and survived to maturity. The inner structures of the testes of the control H. litoralis and H. tigerinus were completely normal, with seminiferous tubules filled with compact bundles of normal spermatozoa. Those of the reciprocal hybrids between H. litoralis and H. tigerinus were almost normal or slightly abnormal, with seminiferous tubules that contained pycnotic nuclei in addition to normal bundles of normal spermatozoa, which demonstrates slight abnormalities in spermatogenesis. In contrast, the hybrids between female H. rugulosus and male H. litoralis or H. tigerinus had no bundles of spermatozoa nor spermatids in the seminiferous tubules, which indicates entirely abnormal spermatogenesis. Meiotic chromosome figures in the reciprocal hybrids between H. litoralis and H. tigerinus showed slight abnormalities, with the occurrence of univalents and increase of rod-shaped bivalents. These results indicate that H. litoralis and H. tigerinus are not isolated from each other by hybrid inviability nor by hybrid sterility, although the hybrids showed somewhat abnormal spermatogenesis in hybrids and that H. rugulosus is isolated from both H. litoralis and H. tigerinus by incomplete hybrid inviability and complete hybrid sterility.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Mahmudul","family":"Hasan"},{"given":"Mohammed Mafizul","family":"Islam"},{"given":"Md Mukhlesur Rahman","family":"Khan"},{"given":"Ratanasate","family":"Wanichanon"},{"given":"Atsushi","family":"Kurabayashi"},{"given":"Masayuki","family":"Sumida"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"1","page":"27-38","page-first":"27","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160026","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<27:RIMITB>2.0.CO;2-N"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160026","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<27:RIMITB>2.0.CO;2-N","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160026"}

Short-tailed viper snakes (Gloydius saxatilis) of South Korea are found mostly in high elevation mountainous areas, but few studies have evaluated how their distribution relates to elevation gradient. This study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 to investigate the altitudinal distribution of short-tailed viper snakes in mountainous areas and to discover their movement patterns in Cheon-ma Mountain County Park in South Korea. A translocation method utilizing radio-tracking technology was employed to confirm whether their distribution was influenced by altitude. The results showed that most short-tailed vipers were observed in middle and high altitude areas (from 400 m to 800 m), but none were observed in low altitude areas (from 200 m to 400 m). According to the results of the translocation and tracking experiments, the individuals of the translocated group showed a significantly broader home range than those of the control group. In addition, all individuals of the translocated group moved vertically, while most of the control group moved horizontally. Therefore, all translocated individuals tended to move back toward their original habitat, a high elevation area. Consequently, we concluded that the distribution of short-tailed viper snakes was limited by altitude.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Min Seock","family":"Do"},{"given":"Ki-Baek","family":"Nam"},{"given":"Jeong-Chil","family":"Yoo"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"1","page":"39-47","page-first":"39","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160126","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<39:DAMTOS>2.0.CO;2-E"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160126","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<39:DAMTOS>2.0.CO;2-E","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160126"}

The Omei treefrog (Rhacophorus omeimontis), endemic to subtropical and mountainous forests of central and southwestern China, is a polyandrous lek-patterned breeder commonly showing multiple males-one female matings during the breeding season. To detect the traits of social and genetic polyandry in this species and explore the relationships between these traits, we investigated the breeding behaviors of a population of R. omeimontis in the Fengtongzhai National Nature Reserve, Baoxing County, Sichuan, China. We conducted paternity analyses using six microsatellite genetic markers. A total of 30 matings were recorded in the field (four monogamous pairs and 26 spawning groups). Our results revealed high proportions of social polyandry (86.7%) and multiple paternity (70.0%) and the numbers of joining males and genetic fathers among matings ranged from 1 to 8 and from 1 to 4, respectively. There was a significantly positive correlation between the intensities of social and genetic polyandry, indicating that multiple males-one female breeding behaviors could be an important promoter of multiple paternity. We considered the intense social polyandry and multiple paternity as consequences of intense male-male competition under a male-biased sex ratio and genetic benefits pursuing of the females. However, the proportion of genetic fathers in a spawning decreased with the increase of joining male number and most of their offspring belonged to a few males. This might be caused by a “making the best of a bad lot” reproductive strategy of the inferior male individuals.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Hui","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Zhenhua","family":"Luo"},{"given":"Jian","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Mian","family":"Zhao"},{"given":"Hua","family":"Wu"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"1","page":"48-54","page-first":"48","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160021","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<48:SPAMPI>2.0.CO;2-E"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160021","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<48:SPAMPI>2.0.CO;2-E","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160021"}

Lizards improve their adaptability and survival by learning the position of their shelter in a complex environment. This behavior raises the question, whether lizards can sense danger, such as a trap, in their surroundings, by determining the location of the trap and avoiding it. In the present study, we used a pitfall trap to test if steppe toad-headed agama, Phrynocephalus frontalis, can learn to recognize the position of the trap and avoid it. Our results revealed that the percentage of activity time in the trap area was significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.001) and the time of drop trap was also significantly reduced (P = 0.00631). The number of burrows dug by lizards distributed in the trap area was the least. Reduced activity time in the trap area was observed to have no obvious relationship with the drop in the number of burrows. The present study, therefore, demonstrates that P. frontalis are capable of learning the avoidance of a trap by locating its position. The findings offer significant insight in the understanding of reptilian behavior, which is important in the study of the role of reptiles in global ecology, especially because they are often very sensitive to environmental changes.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Mingxia","family":"Fu"},{"given":"Shaoyong","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Zhichao","family":"He"},{"given":"Zhiliang","family":"Jie"},{"given":"Junhuai","family":"Bi"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"1","page":"55-60","page-first":"55","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160007","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<55:BOPFTA>2.0.CO;2-N"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160007","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<55:BOPFTA>2.0.CO;2-N","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160007"}

The magnitude of selection was measured using Jacobs’ index of selectivity. Entrance height and width of the  burrows of adults were significantly larger than those of juveniles, but the difference in burrow depth was not significant. The directional orientation of the burrow entrance showed a preference for the north-northeast and south-southeast, which were likely influenced by local prevailing winds and sunlight. Both the adult and juvenile  geckos prefer to construct their burrows in sandy soil within a layer of loose soil whose thickness is greater than 30 cm. A majority of the burrows were located within 20 m of the nearest plant. Nearly half (48%) of the entrances of juveniles were located within 5 m of the nearest vegetation, significantly different from those of the adults. Results showed that the Turpan wonder gecko did not utilize microhabitats according to their availability, but rather that it preferred microhabitats which contained dead wood or the caper bush.

Methods of mark-recapture and transect survey were used to investigate the density of steppe toad-headed lizards and the environmental variables. The comparison on lizard densities among the habitats with different environmental factors revealed that: 1) population density of the steppe toad-headed lizard differed significantly among the habitats with different sand grain size indexes (SGSIs, representing roughness of sand substrate): the highest lizard density was found in the group with an SGSI of &gt; 0.30, whereas the lowest density was found in the group with an SGSI of 0?0.15; and 2) vegetation cover, soil moisture, invertebrate diversity index, and abundance had no significant effects on the lizard density. These results implied that the sand grain size was the most important determinant of habitat selection for steppe toad-headed lizards in Hunshandake Desert. Steppe toad-headed lizards could avoid structural habitats that have negative effects on their maximal sprinting capabilities.

Phylogeographical and dating analyses of B. gargarizans were performed using mitochondrial DNA sequencing with a length of 1436 bp. A mtDNA tree that indicated seven major clades was obtained. The earliest split in the mtDNA tree corresponding to the divergence of populations from the western highland region occurred approximately 4.0 million years ago (mya). A subsequent clade occurred about 3.4 mya, with cladogenesis continuing toward the end of the Pleistocene. The continental clades were distributed in the western, central and northeastern regions of China. Zhoushan Archipelago clades consisted of two largely geographically overlapping subclades with the mtDNA divergence time of 0.73 mya. These results indicated there was extensive dispersal after vicariance. The B. gargarizans populations on Zhoushan Archipelago most probably originated from populations in nearby eastern continental regions of China.

Cathelicidins are an important family of AMPs that have been identified exclusively in vertebrates. However, up to now, cathelicidins from amphibians are poorly understood. In the present study, we reported the identification and characterization of two novel cathelicidins (FM-CATH1 and FM-CATH2) from the frog Fejervarya multistriata. The cDNA sequences encoding FM-CATHs were successfully cloned from the constructed lung cDNA library of F. multistriata. Both of the cDNA sequences encoding FM-CATHs are 447 bp in length, and the deduced mature peptides of FM-CATHs are composed of 34 residues. Structural analysis indicated that FM-CATH1 and FM-CATH2 mainly assume amphipathic alpha-helical conformations. Antimicrobial and bacterial killing kinetic analysis indicated that both FM-CATH1 and FM-CATH2 possess potent, broad-spectrum and rapid antimicrobial potency. And cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization analysis indicated that FM-CATH1 and FM-CATH2 kill bacteria by inducing the permeabilization of bacterial membrane. Besides direct antimicrobial activities, FM-CATHs also exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the formation of bacterial biofilms at low concentrations below 1×MIC. Furthermore, FM-CATH1 and FM-CATH2 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting LPS-induced transcription and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Meanwhile, FM-CATHs showed relatively low cytotoxic activity against mammalian normal and tumor cell lines, and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes. In summary, the identification of FM-CATHs provides novel clues for our understanding of the roles of cathelicidins in amphibian immune systems. The potent antimicrobial, biofilm inhibitory, anti-inflammatory activities, and low cytotoxicity of FM-CATHs imply their great potential in novel antibiotics development.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Aili","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Yan","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Haining","family":"Yu"},{"given":"Yipeng","family":"Wang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"3","page":"199-212","page-first":"199","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160067","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<199:NCWPAB>2.0.CO;2-P"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160067","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<199:NCWPAB>2.0.CO;2-P","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.160067"}

Aromatase, encoded by the cyp19a1 gene, which converts androgens into estrogens in animals, was considered to be the key gene for TSD. In this study, the 5’-flanking region of the cyp19a1 gene in Reeves’ turtle (Mauremys reevesii) was cloned, and the promoter region was identified using the luciferase reporter assay. Then the eggs of Reeves’ turtle were incubated at different temperatures (26°C: male-biased temperature; 29°C: non-sex-biased temperature and 32°C: female-biased temperature). During the thermosensitive period, the adrenal kidney gonad complexes (AKG) were sampled. DNA methylation analysis of the AKG samples showed that the promoter region of the cyp19a1 gene was significantly de-methylated in the female-biased temperature regime (P&lt;0.01). Quantitative analysis of the cyp19a1 gene and estrogen by qPCR and Elisa assay showed that the expression level of the cyp19a1 gene and estrogen content were both upregulated significantly at the female-biased temperature (P&lt;0.01). These results indicated that the de-methylation response of the cyp19a1 gene to incubation temperature, especially at the female-biased temperature, could lead to temperature-specific expression of aromatase and increased estrogen levels, which may further determine gonadal development in Reeves’ turtle. These findings provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying TSD.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Wenxiu","family":"Ru"},{"given":"Liushuai","family":"Hua"},{"given":"Yufeng","family":"Wei"},{"given":"Weiye","family":"Li"},{"given":"Dainan","family":"Cao"},{"given":"Yan","family":"Ge"},{"given":"Hong","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Xianyong","family":"Lan"},{"given":"Shiping","family":"Gong"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"8","issue":"3","page":"213-220","page-first":"213","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170021","SICI:2095-0357(2017)8<213:TEOTC>2.0.CO;2-#"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170021","SICI":"2095-0357(2017)8<213:TEOTC>2.0.CO;2-#","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170021"}

Males had a lower survival rate (6%) than females (14%) across the age range from hatchling to adult, which supported the discovered female-biased sex ratio potentially associated with the low survival rate of males between hatchlings and juveniles. Male-biased SSD in tail length and head width existed in adults rather than in hatchling or juvenile lizards. The growth rates in body dimensions were undistinguishable between the sexes during the age from hatchling to juvenile, but the growth rate in head length from juvenile to adult was significantly larger in males than females.

However, dissolved oxygen did not affect development time, mortality, and telomere length of the tadpoles.

All rearrangement events discovered in the Ranidae mitogenomes can be explained by the duplication and random loss model.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Jiandong","family":"Yang"},{"given":"Jiaojiao","family":"Yu"},{"given":"Jiabin","family":"Liu"},{"given":"Ming","family":"Zhou"},{"given":"Biao","family":"Li"},{"given":"Bo","family":"Ouyang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"9","issue":"2","page":"85-98","page-first":"85","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170084","SICI:2095-0357(2018)9<85:TNRMAT>2.0.CO;2-6"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170084","SICI":"2095-0357(2018)9<85:TNRMAT>2.0.CO;2-6","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170084"}

However, there is a large gap in tadpole research, which represents a vital component of our understanding of the diversity and complexity of the life history traits of amphibians, especially their developmental biology. Some aspects of this gap are due to limited research approaches. To date, X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) has been widely used to conduct osteology research in adult amphibians and reptiles, but little is known about whether this tool can be applied in tadpole studies. Thus, we compared the results of two methods (the bone-cartilage double-staining technique and micro-CT) to study vertebrae in tadpole specimens. The results revealed no significant difference between the two methods in determining the number of vertebrae, and micro-CT represents a rapid, non-invasive, reliable method of studying tadpole vertebrae. When scanning tadpoles, voltage is the most critical of the scanning parameters (voltage, current and scan time), and moderate scanning parameters are recommended. In addition, micro-CT performed better using specimens stored in 70% ethanol than those preserved in 10% formalin. Finally, we suggest that micro-CT should be more widely applied in herpetological research to increase specimen utilization.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Guocheng","family":"Shu"},{"given":"Shan","family":"Xiong"},{"given":"Wenyan","family":"Zhang"},{"given":"Jianping","family":"Jiang"},{"given":"Cheng","family":"Li"},{"given":"Feng","family":"Xie"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"9","issue":"2","page":"99-109","page-first":"99","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180003","SICI:2095-0357(2018)9<99:ARNMFA>2.0.CO;2-P"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180003","SICI":"2095-0357(2018)9<99:ARNMFA>2.0.CO;2-P","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180003"}

Current biodiversity conservation activities usually focus on species that are rare, endemic, distinctive, or at risk of extinction. However, empirical studies of whether such species contribute more to aspects of biodiversity than common species are still relatively rare. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of individual amphibian species to different facets of biodiversity, and to test whether species of conservation interest contribute more to taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity than do species without special conservation status. To answer these questions, 19 000 simulated random communities with a gradient of species richness were created by shuffling the regional pool of species inhabiting Emei Mountain. Differences of diversity values were then computed before and after removing individual species in these random communities. Our results indicated that although individual species contributed similarly to taxonomic diversity, their contribution to functional and phylogenetic diversity was more idiosyncratic. This was primarily driven by the diverse functional attributes of species and the differences in phylogenetic relationships among species. Additionally, species of conservation interest did not show a significantly higher contribution to any facet of biodiversity. Our results support the claims that the usefulness of metrics based only on species richness is limited. Instead, assemblages that include species with functional and phylogenetic diversity should be protected to maintain biodiversity.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Tian","family":"Zhao"},{"given":"Bin","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Guocheng","family":"Shu"},{"given":"Cheng","family":"Li"},{"given":"Jianping","family":"Jiang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"9","issue":"2","page":"110-118","page-first":"110","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170079","SICI:2095-0357(2018)9<110:ASCSTT>2.0.CO;2-M"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170079","SICI":"2095-0357(2018)9<110:ASCSTT>2.0.CO;2-M","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170079"}

We incubated eggs under five thermal regimes (22, 25, 28, 25 ± 3 and 27 ± 5 °C) to examine the effects of constant versus fluctuating temperatures on incubation length and hatchling morphology. In our sample the largest male and female were 110 mm and 108 mm snout-vent length (SVL), respectively. Adult males and females did not differ in mean SVL; adult males were larger in head size (both length and width), longer in fore- and hind-limb lengths and shorter in abdomen length than females of the same SVL. Accordingly, we conclude that S. incognitus is a sexually monomorphic species in terms of SVL but shows sexual dimorphism in head size, abdomen length and appendage length. Females laid a single clutch of 3?10 eggs per breeding season from early May to mid-August, with larger females generally laying more (but not always larger) eggs per clutch than did smaller ones. Embryonic stages at laying ranged from Dufaure and Hubert’s (1961) stage 31 to 32, with a mean stage of 31.3. The positive relationship between clutch mass and female SVL was not significant. The offspring size-number trade-off does not exist in S. incognitus, as revealed by the fact that egg mass was independent of relative fecundity. Incubation length decreased as temperature increased, and stable temperatures resulted in delayed hatching. Hatchlings incubated under the five thermal regimes did not differ from each other in any examined trait, suggesting that S. incognitus is among oviparous reptilian species where incubation temperature has no role in modifying hatchling morphology as long as eggs are not exposed to extreme temperatures for prolonged periods of time.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Li","family":"Ma"},{"given":"Jianchi","family":"Pei"},{"given":"Cuntong","family":"Zhou"},{"given":"Yu","family":"Du"},{"given":"Xiang","family":"Ji"},{"given":"Wen","family":"Shen"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"9","issue":"2","page":"119-128","page-first":"119","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180011","SICI:2095-0357(2018)9<119:SDFRCA>2.0.CO;2-I"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180011","SICI":"2095-0357(2018)9<119:SDFRCA>2.0.CO;2-I","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180011"}

For example, following such events, species can become prone to inbreeding and genetic drift which can lead to a loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary potentials. Hynobius chinensis is a poorly studied very rare and declining endangered amphibian species endemic to China in Changyang County. We investigated adult census population size by monitoring breeding populations from 2015 to 2018, developed microsatellite markers from the transcriptome and used them to investigate genetic diversity, and a population bottleneck in this species. We found H. chinensis in 4 different localities in a total area of 2.18 km2 and estimated the overall adult census population size at 386?404 individuals. The adult census size (mean ± SE) per breeding pond ranged from 44 ± 6 to 141 ± 8 individuals and appeared smaller than that reported in closely related species in undisturbed habitats. We developed and characterized 13 microsatellite markers in total. Analysis of data at 7 loci (N = 118) in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium gathered from the largest population showed that genetic diversity level was low. The average number of alleles per locus was 2.14. The observed and expected heterozygosities averaged 0.38 and 0.40, respectively. The inbreeding coefficient was ?0.06. All tests performed to investigate a population bottleneck, i.e. The Garza-Williamson test, Heterozygosity excess test, Mode shift test of allele frequency, and effective population size estimates detected a population bottleneck. The contemporary and the historical effective population sizes were estimated at 36 and 234 individuals, respectively. We argue that as bottleneck effects, the studied population may have become prone to genetic drift and inbreeding, losing microsatellite alleles and heterozygosity. Our results suggest that populations of H. chinensis may have been extirpated in the study area.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Eric Gilbert","family":"Kazitsa#"},{"given":"Shichao","family":"Wei#"},{"given":"Yunhai","family":"Pu"},{"given":"Xingyan","family":"Wu"},{"given":"Lin","family":"Song"},{"given":"Lei","family":"Gao"},{"given":"Fuyuan","family":"Qiu"},{"given":"Yue","family":"Guo"},{"given":"Zhaoquan","family":"Zhu"},{"given":"Hua","family":"Wu"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"9","issue":"3","page":"149-164","page-first":"149","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180027","SICI:2095-0357(2018)9<149:PSGDAM>2.0.CO;2-E"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180027","SICI":"2095-0357(2018)9<149:PSGDAM>2.0.CO;2-E","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180027"}

Such a behavior was not evident when exposed to predators housed in a glass beaker (visual cues). Both early (Gosner stage 27?28) and later (Gosner stage 35?36) stage tadpoles when exposed to caged predators (fed with conspecific tadpoles), prey tadpoles spent less time swimming and remained motionless for longer periods. Yet, the time spent by prey in feeding was unaffected. Further, the predator avoidance behavior exhibited by them was of the same intensity regardless of whether the caged predators were fed or starved implying the influence of predator’s kairomones. Tadpoles reared with caged predator reached the metamorphic climax stage (MC stage; Gosner stage 42) earlier than those reared without a predator. Size at emergence (Gosner stage 46) was comparable in both the groups. The findings suggest that P. maculatus tadpoles assess predation risk chiefly by sensing kairomones of the predator in eliciting antipredator defense behaviors.

The Chinese cobra (Naja atra) is a large sized, venomous snake commonly found in southeastern China, where it causes a heavy burden of snakebites. To examine the effects of various factors (morphology, sex, age, season, and geographical origin) on the venom yield in this snake, we collected venom samples of 446 individuals (426 adults and 20 neonates) from 10 populations of N. atra over an eight-year period. We used two variables, lyophilized venom mass (venom yield) and solid content of venom (% solids), to quantify the venom yield. We used linear regression analysis to check if venom yield was related to morphological factors, one-way ANOVA and one-way ANCOVA to detect the sexual, ontogenetic, and geographic variation in venom yield, and repeated-measures ANOVA to examine seasonal shifts in venom yield. Our results indicate that venom yield of N. atra is positively related to the morphological traits examined, with male snakes expelling more venom than females. Venom yield in N. atra was age-related, with elder snakes always expelling more venom than younger ones. Geographic variation in venom yield was also observed, while seasonal variation was not. The solid content of venom was lower in males than in females, but this was not related to morphology, season, age, or geography.

Using GIS-based and phylogenetic comparative methods, we investigated global patterns of variation in climatic niche breadth in lacertid lizards to test the following three hypotheses about climatic niche widths. First, does a species’ temperature or precipitation niche breadth relate to its temperature or precipitation niche position (the mean value of annual mean temperature or annual precipitation across sampled localities in the range of each species)? Second, are there trade-offs between a species’ temperature niche breadth and precipitation niche breadth? Third, does a species’ temperature or precipitation niche breadth relate to altitude or latitude? We expect that: (1) species distributed in cold regions are specialized for low-temperature environments (i.e. narrow niche breadth center around low temperatures); (2) a negative relationship between species niche breadth on temperature and precipitation axes according to the trade-off hypothesis (i.e. species that tolerate a broad range of precipitation regimes cannot also tolerate a broad range of temperatures); (3) precipitation niche breadth decreases with altitude or latitude, whereas temperature climatic niche breadth increases with altitude or latitude. Based on the analytical results we found that: (1) temperature niche breadth and position are negatively related, while precipitation niche breadth and position are positively related; (2) there is no trade-off between temperature and precipitation niche breadths; and (3) temperature niche breadth and latitude/altitude are positively related, but precipitation niche breadth and latitude/altitude are not significantly related. Our results show many similarities with previous studies on climatic niche widths reported for amphibians and lizards, which provide further evidence that such macroecological patterns of variation in climatic niche breadths may be widespread.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,25]]},"author":[{"given":"Mengchao","family":"Fang"},{"given":"Xiaming","family":"Zhu"},{"given":"Yu","family":"Du"},{"given":"Lin","family":"Zhang"},{"given":"Longhui","family":"Lin"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"10","issue":"1","page":"41-47","page-first":"41","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180034","SICI:2095-0357(2019)10<41:MPOCNB>2.0.CO;2-P"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180034","SICI":"2095-0357(2019)10<41:MPOCNB>2.0.CO;2-P","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180034"}

Specific habitat requirements often limit distribution range as well as facilitate partitioning resource utilization in ecological similar species. Understanding niche segregation and differences in microhabitat utilization can contribute to identifying coexistence mechanisms between parapatric species. Feirana quadranus and F. taihangnica are two closely related frog species with parapatric geographic ranges and an elongated contact zone within the Qinling Mountains, which is an important watershed for East Asia. Here, we analysed the difference in microhabitat utilization between the two frog species and explored the key ecological factors that induced their microhabitat differentiation based on quadrats sampled in the contact zone. Our comparison of twenty environmental variables showed that both species used microhabitats with alkalescent warm water and gentle slope conditions. The principal component analysis indicated that climate-related variables, vegetation conditions, and river width were the important factors for microhabitat utilization of these species. These findings contribute to our understanding on the coexistence mechanisms of these two related and parapatric Asian mountain frog species.

Phase 1, from Day 0 (at laying) to Day 15 (~36% of the way through incubation), was one of minimal transfer of material from yolk to embryo. Phase 2, from Day 15 to Day 32?33 (~77%?80% of the way through incubation), was characterized by increasingly rapid embryonic growth or yolk depletion.

The length of the last embryonic stage (Stage 40 = completely differentiated embryos) accounted for about 28% of incubation length, and the dry mass of the smallest embryos of Stage 40 accounted for only ~48% of the hatchling dry mass.

Analyses reveal similar basic skin structures, but N. parkeri differs from the other species by having more epidermal capillaries and granular glands, which correlate highly with responses to hypoxia and/or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Further intraspecific comparisons from frogs taken at ~4500 m and ~2900 m reveal that all of the changes are fixed. Changes occurring only in the higher elevation population, such as possessing more skin pigments, may represent local adaptations to coldness and/or UV radiation.

For example, the genus Trimerodytes Cope, 1895 was long been regarded as a junior synonym of Opisthotropis Günther, 1872 for their similar prefrontal configurations and the type species, T. balteatus Cope, 1895, has been assigned to the genus Opisthotropis. However, as the number and arrangement of prefrontal vary frequently both at species and generic level, it is questionable whether the synonymization of Trimerodytes reflects their evolutionary relationships. On the basis of recently collected specimens of O. balteata, the generic status of the species was assessed using both molecular and morphological data. Opisthotropis was recovered as polyphyletic with reference to O. balteata, because O. balteata is nested within the genus Sinonatrix Rossman and Eberle, 1977 and is the sister species of the type species of Sinonatrix. Consequently, we herein resurrect the long-overlooked synonym Trimerodytes from Opisthotropis and synonymize the junior generic nomen Sinonatrix with Trimerodytes. In addition, based on morphological similarities between the monotypic genus Paratapinophis Angel, 1929 and Trimerodytes, we doubt about the validity of Paratapinophis. Following taxonomic changes in this work, the taxonomic account of the genus Trimerodytes, updated descriptions of its type species, and diagnostic key to Trimerodytes species are provided.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,20]]},"author":[{"given":"Jinlong","family":"Ren"},{"given":"Kai","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Peng","family":"Guo"},{"given":"Yingyong","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Tao Thien","family":"Nguyen"},{"given":"Jiatang","family":"Li"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"10","issue":"2","page":"105-128","page-first":"105","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180091","SICI:2095-0357(2019)10<105:OTGTOO>2.0.CO;2-U"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180091","SICI":"2095-0357(2019)10<105:OTGTOO>2.0.CO;2-U","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180091"}

Consequently, their small and isolated populations in fragmented landscapes are facing genetic and demographic threats. Evaluating the spatial distribution pattern of Naja oxiana, identifying core habitat patches and improving landscape connectivity among the patches have a significant role in the long-term survival of the species. This study predicts the spatial distribution map of the Caspian cobra considering the factors affecting the predictive power of the distribution models, including sampling bias in presence points, correct selection of background locations, and input model parameters. The sampling bias in presence points was removed using spatial filtering. Several models were run using 19 environmental variables that eventually led to the selection of the effective habitat variables and best MaxEnt distribution model. We also used an ensemble model (EM) of habitat suitability methods to predict the potential habitats of the species. Topographical roughness, shrublands, average annual precipitation, and sparse rangeland with a density of ≤ 20% had the most effect on the spatial distribution of Caspian cobra. The evaluation of models confirmed that the EM has more predictive performance than MaxEnt in predicting the distribution of Naja oxiana.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,20]]},"author":[{"given":"Elmira","family":"Kazemi"},{"given":"Mohammad","family":"Kaboli"},{"given":"Rasoul","family":"Khosravi"},{"given":"Nematollah","family":"Khorasani"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"10","issue":"2","page":"129-138","page-first":"129","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180063","SICI:2095-0357(2019)10<129:ETIOEV>2.0.CO;2-W"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180063","SICI":"2095-0357(2019)10<129:ETIOEV>2.0.CO;2-W","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180063"}

Some Thai populations were found to have both lineages represented within them. Highly significant genetic differentiation (FST) showed geographic population structuring in Lineage B, indicating limited gene flow among groups in Thailand. Although G. gecko has a wide distribution and is well adapted to human habitation, the observed genetic structure could potentially be explained by geographic barriers such as mountain ranges.

Here we studied altitudinal variation in the digestive tract across four Feirana quadranus populations and tested the hypothesis that relative size of digestive tract should increase with increasing altitude. The results showed that although significant variation in length of the digestive tract was observed in females among populations, altitudinal variation in relative length of digestive tract or gut was non-significant. In addition, the digestive tract length was not correlated with temperature and precipitation across the four populations. Our findings suggest that individuals living in low-temperature and -precipitation populations at high altitudes did not display longer digestive tract than high temperature and precipitation populations at low altitudes, possibly because of small populations or sample sizes.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,23]]},"author":[{"given":"Chunlan","family":"Mai"},{"given":"Jin","family":"Huang"},{"given":"Qin","family":"Liao"},{"given":"Wenbo","family":"Liao"},{"given":"And Lixia","family":"Zhang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"10","issue":"3","page":"183-189","page-first":"183","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180082","SICI:2095-0357(2019)10<183:AVIDTL>2.0.CO;2-T"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180082","SICI":"2095-0357(2019)10<183:AVIDTL>2.0.CO;2-T","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180082"}

Understanding thermally physiological responses of sympatric lizards is necessary to reveal the physiological mechanisms that underpin the sympatric occurrence of reptiles. In this study, we used three lizard species, Eremias argus, E. multiocellata, and Phrynocephalus przewalskii, which are sympatric in the Inner Mongolia desert steppe, as a study system. By comparing their resting metabolic rates (RMR) and locomotion at different body temperatures, we aimed to better understand their physiological responses to thermal environments, which may explain the sympatric occurrence of these lizards. Our results showed that E. argus had significantly higher RMR and sprint speed than E. multiocellata, and higher RMR than P. przewalskii. In addition, the optimal temperature that maximized metabolic rates and locomotion for E. argus and E. multiocellata was 36°C, whereas for P. przewalskii it was 39°C. Our study revealed the physiological responses to temperatures that justify the sympatric occurrence of these lizards with different thermal and microhabitat preferences and active body temperatures. Eremias argus and E. multiocellata, which have lower body temperatures than P. przewalskii, depend on higher RMR and locomotion to compensate for their lower body temperatures in field conditions.

Motion-capture technology is utilized to quantify and characterize locomotor behaviors to reveal the mechanisms of animal motion. In the capture of flexible, small animals with complex locomotor behaviors, the markers interfere with each other easily, and the motion forms (bending, twisting) of the moving parts are obviously different; thus, it is a great challenge to realize accurate quantitative characterization of complex locomotor behaviors. The correlation between the marker properties, including the size and space length, and the precision of the system are revealed in this paper, and the effects of diverse marker shapes on the capturing accuracy of the captured objects in different motion forms were tested. Results showed that the precision of system is significantly improved when the ratio of the space length to the diameter of the markers is larger than four; for the capture of the spatial twisting motion of the flexible object, the hexagon markers had the lowest spatial lost-marker rate relative to the circle, triangle, and square. Customized markers were used to capture the locomotor behavior of the gecko-inspired robot (rigid connection) and the gecko (flexible connection). The results showed that this marking technology can achieve high accuracy of motion capture for geckos (the average deviation was approximately 0.32 mm, and the average deviation’s variation rate was approximately 0.96%). In this paper, the marking technology for the motion capture of flexible, small animals with complex motion is proposed; it can effectively improve the system precision as well as the capture accuracy, and realize the quantitative characterization of the complex motion of flexible, small objects. It provides a reliable technical means to deeply study the evolution of the motion function of small animals and advance systematic research of motion-capture technology.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,23]]},"author":[{"given":"Zhouyi","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Weijia","family":"Zong"},{"given":"Bingcheng","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Junjie","family":"Zhu"},{"given":"Kai","family":"Qin"},{"given":"Zhendong","family":"Dai"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"10","issue":"3","page":"197-210","page-first":"197","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180071","SICI:2095-0357(2019)10<197:TMTIMC>2.0.CO;2-1"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180071","SICI":"2095-0357(2019)10<197:TMTIMC>2.0.CO;2-1","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180071"}

The results of the cross-species method supported the rule only when the influence of the low-frequency occurrence probability of an investigated species was excluded, whereas those of the Steven’s method strongly corroborated the rule regardless of the incidental occurrence or absence of the species.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"given":"Zhiqiang","family":"Chen"},{"given":"Yun","family":"Tang"},{"given":"Yingying","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Yindie","family":"Li"},{"given":"Longhui","family":"Lin"},{"given":"Guohua","family":"Ding"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"11","issue":"1","page":"44-55","page-first":"44","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190038","SICI:2095-0357(2020)11<44:SDAEDO>2.0.CO;2-I"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190038","SICI":"2095-0357(2020)11<44:SDAEDO>2.0.CO;2-I","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190038"}

However, light may be harmful for reptile embryos developing underground where they are in complete darkness and beneath thin eggshells. Nonetheless, how embryonic light conditions affect reptile development and offspring remains largely unknown. Here we incubated eggs in dark and light conditions to determine the effects of light exposure on embryonic development and offspring visual ability, spatial cognitive ability and growth in a lacertid lizard, Eremias argus. Our experiments demonstrated that light stimulation shortened incubation duration of eggs, but did not affect hatching success, offspring size, visual ability or survival. More interestingly, light exposure during incubation decreased spatial cognitive ability and post-hatching growth of offspring. On the basis of negative effects on offspring growth rates, our study indicates that in squamate reptiles with thin eggshells, light exposure in early development has negative effects on offspring cognitive ability.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"given":"Xinghan","family":"Li"},{"given":"Chenxu","family":"Wang"},{"given":"Guoshuai","family":"Tang"},{"given":"Shuran","family":"Li"},{"given":"Liang","family":"Ma"},{"given":"Baojun","family":"Sun"},{"given":"Yongpu","family":"Zhang"}],"container-title":"Asian Herpetological Research","volume":"11","issue":"1","page":"56-62","page-first":"56","ISSN":["2095-0357"],"alternative-id":["DOI:10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190004","SICI:2095-0357(2020)11<56:DLEDED>2.0.CO;2-8"],"DOI":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190004","SICI":"2095-0357(2020)11<56:DLEDED>2.0.CO;2-8","guid":"10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.190004"}

One major trend of morphological variations was clinal: populations from the west tended to have a larger size with wider head and longer posterior limbs than populations from the east. Species history, with an early extended isolation and two subsequent secondary contacts, may explain most of the geographical clinal variations of O. margaretae.
